# ðŸ§ª Exploring Microhydrodynamics with Mathematica

This is a collection of Mathematica notebooks and handwritten-style PDFs where Iâ€™ve worked through the core concepts of **microhydrodynamics**, especially focused on low Reynolds number (Stokes) flow. The goal was to build up both the physical intuition and the mathematical machinery behind slow viscous flows â€” from basics like reversibility to more advanced tools like the reciprocal theorem.

Everything here is symbolic, analytical, and tries to stay as close to the fundamentals as possible â€” no black-box simulations. Just tensors, vector calculus, and some clean visuals.

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside

### Core Notebooks
- `S1.nb` â€” Starts with linearity, reversibility, and streamlines; includes basic field structure
- `S2.nb` â€” Tensor form derivations, pressure and velocity field construction
- `S3.nb` â€” Symmetry arguments, stress calculations, and moment integrals

### Theory Notes (PDFs)
These are notes Iâ€™ve compiled or annotated while going through the math:
- `sphere-in-a-stokes-flow.pdf` â€” Linearity, instantaneity, dissipation, uniqueness
 â€” Immersed spheres in straining flows, field structure in the XY plane
 â€” First moment of traction, stress tensor decomposition
 â€” Solid angle integrals using delta tensors (a nice shortcut for spherical problems)

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Why Stokes flow is reversible (and when itâ€™s not)
- What makes the velocity field *instantaneous*
- How to derive âŸ¨náµ¢nâ±¼âŸ© and âŸ¨náµ¢nâ±¼nâ‚–nâ‚—âŸ© using only symmetry
- Tensor algebra tricks that avoid brute-force integration
- How the reciprocal theorem helps solve problems without solving the whole PDE
- Why Stokes flow always dissipates the **least** energy

## ðŸŽ¯ Who This Is For

If youâ€™re learning microhydrodynamics, working through Kim & Karrila, or just curious about slow flows and symbolic mechanics, this might help. Itâ€™s especially useful if you prefer seeing derivations done step-by-step in Mathematica rather than just reading final results.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Mathematica** â€” for symbolic manipulations, plots, tensor algebra
- **Handwritten PDFs** â€” for theory and derivations, often built from course notes
